# Task 004: Write Tests for Invitation Email Feature

## Description
Write unit and integration tests for the invitation email flow.

## Requirements
- Test invitation model (creation, constraints)
- Test API endpoint (success, validation, error cases)
- Test email utility (mock Resend API)
- Test end-to-end flow (invite, email sent, onboarding)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Tests are located in backend/app/tests/test_invitations.py (or similar)
- All major branches and edge cases are covered
- Tests pass in CI/CD pipeline

## Technical Details / Impacted Files
- backend/app/tests/test_invitations.py (new or update)
- backend/app/tests/test_email.py (new or update)

## Pseudocode Ideas
```python
# backend/app/tests/test_invitations.py
def test_invite_user_success():
    # Arrange: mock dependencies, prepare input
    # Act: call API endpoint
    # Assert: check DB, email sent, response

def test_invite_user_invalid_email():
    # Arrange: invalid email
    # Act: call API endpoint
    # Assert: error response

# backend/app/tests/test_email.py
def test_send_email_success():
    # Arrange: mock httpx
    # Act: call send_email_via_resend
    # Assert: email sent, no exception
```
