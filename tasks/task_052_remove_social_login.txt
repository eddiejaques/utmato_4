Title: Remove Social Login from Clerk Authentication

Task:
Remove or disable all social login options (e.g., Google, GitHub, etc.) from the authentication flow using Clerk, ensuring only email/password login is available.

Context:
- Frontend:
  - Update Clerk UI components (SignIn, SignUp) to hide or disable social login buttons.
  - Ensure the signup and login flows only present email/password options to users.
  - Update any custom UI or documentation to reflect this change.
  - Test that no social login buttons are visible and that email/password login works as expected.

- Backend:
  - No backend changes are required unless you have custom logic for social login callbacks or user provisioning.
  - Remove or disable any webhook/event handling specific to social providers if present.
  - Test that user creation and authentication via social providers is not possible.

Verification Steps:
1. Attempt to sign up and sign in using social login optionsâ€”verify they are not available.
2. Confirm that email/password authentication works as expected.
3. Review Clerk dashboard to ensure all social providers are disabled.
4. Run frontend tests to verify UI changes.
