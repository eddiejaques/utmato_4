User Story: Campaign Management End-to-End Experience

As a marketing manager or team member,
I want to create, manage, and search campaigns with rich metadata (including demographics, interests, and audiences),
so that my team can maintain consistent campaign tracking, leverage predictive and customizable targeting options, and collaborate efficiently.

Acceptance Criteria:
- I can create and edit campaigns with optional demographics (age, gender), interests, and audiences fields.
- I can select interests and audiences from a comprehensive, predictive list, or add custom values as needed.
- As a manager, I can manage the default lists of interests and audiences for my company in the settings page, ensuring the options reflect our marketing needs.
- The system stores and updates these defaults, making them available to all team members in campaign forms.
- All new fields are optional and do not block campaign creation or editing.
- I can search and filter campaigns using the new metadata fields, improving discoverability and reporting.
- The platform provides a seamless, user-friendly UI for campaign creation, editing, and management, with robust backend support for all new features.
- All new features are covered by backend and frontend tests to ensure reliability and correctness.

Business Value:
- Enables consistent, high-quality campaign metadata across the organization.
- Reduces manual entry and errors by providing predictive, customizable targeting options.
- Empowers managers to tailor the platform to their team's needs.
- Improves campaign discoverability, reporting, and collaboration.
