Step 4: Test Campaign Fields and Company Settings

Task: Add and update test cases to cover the new campaign fields (demographics, interests, audiences) and company settings for default interests/audiences. Ensure backend and frontend tests verify correct behavior for creation, update, and UI rendering. Test predictive search and custom value addition in the campaign form.

Files:
- backend/app/tests/: Add/extend tests for campaign creation/update with new fields, and company settings endpoints.
- frontend/src/components/Campaigns/CampaignForm.test.tsx: Add/extend tests for form rendering, predictive search, and custom value addition.
- frontend/src/app/user-profile/[[...user-profile]]/page.test.tsx: Add/extend tests for managing company defaults.

Step Dependencies: None (can be executed independently).

User Instructions:
- Run backend and frontend test suites.
- Verify all new and updated tests pass and cover the new features.
