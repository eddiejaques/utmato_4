Section: Campaign Model Enhancement
Step 1: Add Demographics, Interests, and Audiences Fields to Campaign Model

Task: Update the backend campaign model to support optional demographics, interests, and audiences fields. Ensure all three fields are nullable and can store multiple values (use JSON or comma-separated strings as appropriate). Add a new Alembic migration for the audiences field. Update Pydantic schemas and API logic to accept and persist these fields.

Files:
- app/models/campaign.py: Add audiences field (nullable, JSON or String).
- app/schemas/campaign.py: Add demographics, interests, and audiences to CampaignBase, CampaignCreate, and CampaignUpdate (all optional).
- app/api/campaigns.py, app/services/campaign_service.py: Accept and persist new fields.
- migrations/versions/: New Alembic migration for audiences field.

Step Dependencies: None (can be executed independently).

User Instructions:
- Run the Alembic migration to update the database schema.
- Test campaign creation and update endpoints with the new fields.
- Verify that all fields are optional and persisted correctly.
