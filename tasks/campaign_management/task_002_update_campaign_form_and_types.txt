Section: Campaign Form Enhancement
Step 2: Update Campaign Form and Types for Demographics, Interests, and Audiences

Task: Update the frontend campaign creation/edit form to include optional fields for demographics (age, gender), interests, and audiences. Use multi-select with predictive search for interests and audiences, allowing custom values. Update TypeScript types and Redux logic to support the new fields.

Files:
- src/components/Campaigns/CampaignForm.tsx: Add new fields to the form UI and logic.
- src/types/campaign.ts: Add demographics, interests, and audiences to Campaign, CampaignCreate, and CampaignUpdate interfaces.
- src/store/campaignSlice.ts, src/api/campaigns.ts: Update to handle new fields in create/update actions.

Step Dependencies: None (can be executed independently).

User Instructions:
- Test the form for campaign creation and editing with the new fields.
- Verify that the new fields are optional and data is sent to the backend correctly.
