Section 7: User Interface Specifications (Design System & Atomic Design)
Step 1: Establish Design System Foundations (Color, Typography, Spacing)

Task: Define and implement the core design system elements based on the provided specifications. This includes setting up a comprehensive color palette (Primary, Secondary, Neutral, Accent, Semantic colors), typography scales (font families, sizes, weights, line heights for headings, body text, captions), and a consistent spacing system (e.g., based on a 4px or 8px grid).
Files:
tailwind.config.js: Extend Tailwind's default theme with custom colors, fontFamily, fontSize, spacing, and borderRadius values to reflect the design system.
src/styles/base.css: Define base typography styles, global resets (e.g., box-sizing), and import Tailwind's base, components, and utilities.
src/styles/design-tokens.css: (Optional, for non-Tailwind specific tokens) Define CSS variables for design tokens if a more granular approach is needed for certain elements.
Step Dependencies: Section 1, Step 1 (Frontend Project Initialization)
User Instructions: Verify that the defined design tokens are correctly applied across the application by inspecting elements in the browser developer tools. Ensure visual consistency for colors, fonts, and spacing.
