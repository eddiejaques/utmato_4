Step 2: Implement Single and Bulk UTM Link Generation Endpoints


Task: Develop FastAPI endpoints for generating single links. These endpoints should handle parameter parsing, enforce business rules (e.g., utm_source and utm_medium are required), construct the final generated URL, store links in the database with correct campaign association and created_by user, and return the generated UTM links. Bulk generation is not required.
Fields for url construction - url, utm_campaign(campaign id), utm_source, utm_medium(adgroup level), utm_content(ad level), utm_term
Files: 
app/api/utm.py: Add endpoints for POST /utm/generate (single) 
app/schemas/utm.py: Add Pydantic schemas for UTMLinkCreate (for single link), UTMLinkResponse
app/services/utm_service.py: Add business logic for generate_single_utm_link including constructing the URL, saving to DB, and handling errors.
app/utils/utm_builder.py: Helper function for consistent URL parameter construction.
Step Dependencies: Section 5, Step 1; Section 4, Step 1 (Campaign CRUD API)
User Instructions:
Test (via postman, so add directions in backend/readme.md) POST /api/utm/generate with valid campaign IDs and UTM parameters. Verify the generated URL and database entry.
Test (via postman, so add directions in backend/readme.md)  POST /api/utm/generate-bulk with a mix of valid and invalid UTM link requests. Verify that valid links are created and invalid ones are reported in the response.
Check that utm_source and utm_medium are enforced as required.
