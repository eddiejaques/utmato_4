Section 14: Non-Functional Requirements (Performance & Scalability)
Step 1: Implement Logging, Monitoring, and Error Tracking


Task: Set up comprehensive logging for both frontend and backend applications. Integrate monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana or cloud-specific monitoring) to track application health, performance metrics (latency, error rates), and resource utilization. Implement error tracking (e.g., Sentry) for real-time error alerts.
Files:
requirements.txt: Add loguru, sentry-sdk (backend).
package.json: Add sentry-nextjs (frontend).
app/main.py: Configure loguru for structured logging, integrate sentry-sdk initialization.
app/core/logging_config.py: Centralized logging configuration.
next.config.js: Configure Sentry for Next.js.
src/utils/errorLogger.ts: Frontend error boundary or useEffect for Sentry integration.
Step Dependencies: Section 1, Step 1 & 2 (Project Init)
User Instructions:
Integrate with chosen logging/monitoring/error tracking services.
Generate various types of errors (e.g., API errors, frontend crashes) and verify they are captured and reported by the tracking systems.
Observe logs for application activity and health.
