Step 1: Configure Deployment for Frontend and Backend


Task: Set up deployment pipelines for the Next.js frontend (e.g., Vercel, Netlify) and the FastAPI backend (e.g., Railway, Render, Fly.io, or AWS EC2/ECS). Configure environment variables, domain mapping, and ensure secure production deployments.
Files:
vercel.json (if using Vercel): Frontend deployment configuration.
railway.json or Dockerfile for backend: Backend deployment configuration.
nginx.conf (if self-hosting with Nginx): Reverse proxy configuration.
Procfile (if using platforms like Render/Heroku).
.github/workflows/deploy-frontend.yml: (For CI/CD, optional in this step, but foundational).
.github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml: (For CI/CD, optional in this step, but foundational).
Step Dependencies: All previous steps (fully functional application)
User Instructions:
Choose your deployment platforms.
Follow platform-specific guides to link repositories and configure environment variables.
Perform an initial manual deployment of both frontend and backend.
Verify the application is accessible and functional in a production environment.
