Step 3: Set up End-to-End (E2E) Testing


Task: Implement end-to-end tests to simulate full user journeys through the application (e.g., user signup -> create campaign -> generate UTM link -> search). Utilize Playwright for robust browser automation.
Files:
package.json: Add playwright.
e2e/auth.spec.ts: E2E tests for user authentication flow.
e2e/campaigns.spec.ts: E2E tests for campaign creation and management.
e2e/utm.spec.ts: E2E tests for UTM link generation and usage.
playwright.config.ts: Playwright configuration.
Step Dependencies: All functional sections (Auth, Campaigns, UTM, Search, UI)
User Instructions:
Install Playwright browsers (npx playwright install).
Run E2E tests (npx playwright test).
Review test results and screenshots/videos for any failures.
