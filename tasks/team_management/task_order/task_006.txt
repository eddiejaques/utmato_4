- Pending invites list (resend/cancel)
- User list (role change, remove, status badges)
- Profile page (view role/domain, delete own campaigns/UTM links)
- Confirmation dialogs, toasts, error/success feedback

- frontend/src/app/settings/team.tsx: Team management page.
- frontend/src/components/Team/InviteUserForm.tsx: Invite form/modal.
- frontend/src/components/Team/TeamMemberList.tsx: User list table.
- frontend/src/components/Team/PendingInvites.tsx: Pending invites list.
- frontend/src/components/Auth/UserProfile.tsx: Profile page.

User Instructions: Implement and test all UI components. Ensure flows match UX design and user stories. Test all edge cases (invite, accept, reject, role change, remove, self-service).

User Stories Covered:
- All user stories involving UI/UX for team management

Acceptance Criteria:
- UI matches UX design.txt and ux_frontend.txt
- All user flows are accessible and responsive
- All edge cases handled in UI

Edge Cases:
- Invalid input, network/API errors, permission errors, empty states

Test Data/Mocking:
- Use mock API responses and test users for UI testing

UX/UI Review:
- Review with design/UX team after each major UI step

Accessibility/Responsiveness:
- Keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, color contrast, mobile layout

Security & Permissions:
- UI enforces role-based access and hides unauthorized actions

Documentation:
- Storybook or similar for UI components
