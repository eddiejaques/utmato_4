Step 4: Implement Database Migrations

Task: Create Alembic migration scripts to generate all team management tables and relationships. Enable row-level security (RLS) for company-scoped data isolation. Add indexes for performance.
Files:
- backend/migrations/versions/xxxxxxxxxxxx_team_management_models.py: Migration for new tables.
- backend/migrations/versions/xxxxxxxxxxxx_team_management_rls.py: Migration for RLS policies.
Step Dependencies: Section 2, Step 1
User Instructions: Generate and apply migrations. Verify tables and RLS policies are correctly created in the database.

User Stories Covered:
- All stories requiring secure, isolated, and performant data storage

Acceptance Criteria:
- All tables and indexes created
- RLS policies enforce company isolation

Edge Cases:
- Migration failures, RLS misconfiguration

Test Data/Mocking:
- Use migration dry runs and test DBs

Documentation:
- Migration scripts and comments

Retrospective:
- Note any migration or RLS pain points
