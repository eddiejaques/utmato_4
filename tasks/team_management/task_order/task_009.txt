Step 9: Implement Email Sending for Invitations (Resend)

Task: Integrate Resend (https://resend.com), a cost-effective third-party email utility, to send invitation emails automatically when a user is invited via /api/v1/invitations/invite. Ensure the invitee receives an email with the invitation link and token.

Files:
- backend/app/services/invitation_service.py (add Resend email sending logic)
- backend/app/utils/email_utils.py (new utility for sending emails via Resend)
- backend/app/api/invitations.py (update to call email utility after invitation creation)
- backend/requirements.txt (add 'resend' or relevant HTTP client dependency)
- backend/.env (add RESEND_API_KEY and any other required secrets)

Step Dependencies: Step 7 (Invitation API), Step 8 (Frontend tests)

User Instructions:
- Sign up for a Resend account and obtain an API key.
- Implement a utility function to send emails using the Resend API (see https://resend.com/docs/api-reference/emails/send-email).
- Update the invitation creation flow to trigger an email after DB commit.
- Ensure the email contains the invitation link and token.
- Add error handling for email delivery failures (log errors, surface to API response if critical).
- Document configuration steps for Resend setup in README.

User Stories Covered:
- As a manager, I want invited users to receive an email so they can join the team.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Invitation emails are sent to the invitee's address upon invite creation via Resend
- Email contains a working invitation link/token
- Errors in email delivery are logged and surfaced to the API response if critical
- Resend provider configuration is documented

Test Data/Mocking:
- Use Resend's test mode or a sandbox for development
- Mock email sending in unit/integration tests

Retrospective:
- Review email deliverability and Resend cost
- Consider switching providers if deliverability or cost is unsatisfactory
