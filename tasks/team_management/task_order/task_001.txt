Step 1: Review and Align Architecture

Task: Review the architecture for Team Management as described in architecture-team-management.txt. Ensure all planned features (domain ownership, invitations, onboarding, roles, access management, self-service) are mapped to clear API, service, and database layers. Confirm folder and file structure for both frontend and backend matches the architecture diagram.
Files:
- architecture-team-management.txt: Reference for architecture.
- backend/app/api/: API route files for users, invites, roles.
- backend/app/services/: Service logic for user, invite, role management.
- backend/app/models/: ORM models for users, companies, invites, roles.
- backend/app/schemas/: Pydantic schemas for all request/response bodies.
- frontend/src/api/: API abstraction for team management endpoints.
- frontend/src/store/: Redux slices for team, user, invite state.
Step Dependencies: None
User Instructions: Review the architecture document and ensure all technical and UX requirements are mapped to the codebase structure before implementation.

User Stories Covered:
- All user stories in user_stories.txt (domain ownership, invitations, onboarding, roles, access management, self-service)

Acceptance Criteria:
- Architecture diagram and folder structure reviewed and confirmed
- All user stories mapped to technical layers

Documentation:
- Update architecture documentation with any clarifications

Retrospective:
- Capture any gaps or ambiguities in architecture for future improvement
