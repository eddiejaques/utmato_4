Title: Verify Row-Level Security Implementation

Task: Manually verify that the Row-Level Security (RLS) policies are correctly isolating data for companies, users, campaigns, and UTM links.

Dependencies: tasks/task_005.txt

Verification Steps:

1.  **Create Test Data:**
    *   Connect to the PostgreSQL database.
    *   Create two distinct companies (e.g., "Company A" and "Company B").
    *   Create at least one user for each company, ensuring each user has a unique `clerk_id`. Make a note of these `clerk_id`s.

2.  **Run the Application:**
    *   Start the FastAPI backend server.

3.  **Test API Endpoints:**
    *   Use a tool like `curl` or a REST client (like Postman or Insomnia) to make requests to the `/api/v1/companies` endpoint.
    *   **Test Case 1 (User from Company A):**
        *   Make a GET request to `/api/v1/companies`.
        *   Set the request header `x-clerk-user-id` to the `clerk_id` of the user from "Company A".
        *   **Expected Result:** The API should return only the details for "Company A".
    *   **Test Case 2 (User from Company B):**
        *   Make a GET request to `/api/v1/companies`.
        *   Set the request header `x-clerk-user-id` to the `clerk_id` of the user from "Company B".
        *   **Expected Result:** The API should return only the details for "Company B".
    *   **Test Case 3 (Unauthenticated User):**
        *   Make a GET request to `/api/v1/companies` *without* the `x-clerk-user-id` header.
        *   **Expected Result:** The API should return an empty list (`[]`), confirming no data is exposed without authentication.
