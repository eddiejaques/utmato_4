Step 2: Backend Performance Optimization (Advanced)


Task: Implement advanced backend performance optimizations. This includes:
Asynchronous I/O: Ensure all database operations and external API calls are non-blocking using async/await.
Connection Pooling: Configure database connection pooling for efficient resource reuse.
Load Testing: Conduct basic load testing to identify bottlenecks and validate scalability assumptions.
Files:
app/db/database.py: Ensure SQLAlchemy's async engine and session are correctly configured for connection pooling.
app/services/*.py: Review all service methods to ensure proper use of await for database/external calls.
alembic.ini: (Optional) Configure Alembic to use async for migrations.
Step Dependencies: Section 8, Step 2 (Caching)
User Instructions:
Use a load testing tool (e.g., Locust, JMeter) to simulate concurrent users and requests.
Monitor backend metrics (CPU, memory, latency) during load tests to identify and address bottlenecks.
Ensure asynchronous operations are correctly implemented.
