Step 2: Develop Frontend Invitation and User List UI


Task: Create frontend components for managers to invite new team members and view/manage existing team members within their company.
Files:
src/components/Team/InviteUserForm.tsx: Form for managers to invite new users (email, role selection).
src/components/Team/TeamMemberList.tsx: Table displaying existing team members with their roles, and options to revoke/reassign roles (if roles can be changed).
src/store/teamSlice.ts: New Redux slice for managing team member list and invitations.
src/pages/settings/team.tsx: New page for team management.
src/api/invitations.ts: Frontend API service for invitation-related calls.
Step Dependencies: Section 13, Step 1
User Instructions:
As a Manager, navigate to the team settings page.
Invite a new user and observe the invitation status.
Verify the invited user appears in the team list (perhaps as "pending").
Log in as the invited user (after simulating acceptance) and confirm they are part of the correct company with the assigned role.
